# Getting Started

This will be an introductory guide to using Synclets in your application.

Right now, the Synclets project is still in a very early stage of development,
so please be aware that things may change rapidly, and we don't recommend you
use it in production just yet! So this guide is... pretty short.

This guide will get built out quickly as the project matures. In the meantime,
the best way to get _something_ up and running is to use our very basic [Vite
template](https://github.com/tinyplex/vite-synclets).

Good luck!
